**About GTA:Online:**
Do NOT use this online. Although there is no checks if you use this online or not in script (it is open-source, it'd take 10 secs to remove check), rockstar can still detect and ban you. I am not responsible if you get banned.

**How to install:**

**0)** Understand that you'll use it at your own risk.

*Skip to 2 if you have ScriptHookV, skip to 3 if you have both SHV.Net and SHV.*

*OR just watch the video: http://youtu.be/JjGEEMcizwc*

**1)** Download and install [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) (or if you keep not listening to me and want to use it online, [go here](http://www.se7ensins.com/forums/threads/gta-online-online-bypass-1-28-mod-menu-mega-thread-info-thread.1318313/))

**2-1)** Download [ScriptHookVDotNet](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet)'s latest release (available [here](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet/releases)) / download current version's source code and compile (both will work, you pick.)

**2-2)** Install it by copying the .asi and .dll file to GTA V folder.

**3)** [Download this project as zip](https://github.com/ardaozkal/DankNet-GTAV/archive/master.zip) and copy the .cs and .txt files (not license and readme.md) to the /scripts/ folder under your GTAV folder. (if it doesn't exist, create it)

**Done.** *It opens with F6 key.*
